overlays format:

fixed_responses ... if the overlay always is opaque to this test.

optional_responses ... if the overlay may be opaque to this test, depending on config. Allow/deny OPTIONS method and such.

fixed_backend_conditional ... if the overlay generates its own response based on backend behaviour but passes no content through.

alternates ... alternative configured error responses

cleaned_requests ... if the overlay cleans some requests before passing them on to the backend

modified_responses ... if the overlay subtly modifies the backend response before passing it on to us



... ranking will be a problem. ah well.
